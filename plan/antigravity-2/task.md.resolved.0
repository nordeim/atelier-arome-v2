# Task: Create Project Architecture Document

## Objective
Create a comprehensive [Project_Architecture_Document.md](file:///home/project/atelier-arome/Project_Architecture_Document.md) as the single source-of-truth handbook for the Atelier Arôme project.

## Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis & Research
- [x] Read AGENT.md documentation
- [x] Read README.md documentation
- [x] Read GEMINI.md documentation
- [x] Read CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Identify discrepancies between documents

### Phase 2: Codebase Validation
- [x] Validate backend structure (atelier-arome-api/)
- [x] Validate 22 Eloquent models in app/Models/
- [x] Validate 12 API controllers in app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/
- [x] Validate 14 API resources in app/Http/Resources/
- [x] Validate routes in routes/api.php
- [x] Validate 26 migrations in database/migrations/
- [x] Validate 7 seeders in database/seeders/
- [x] Validate frontend structure (atelier-arome-web/)
- [x] Validate App Router structure (src/app/)
- [x] Validate components (catalog/, hero/, layout/, sections/, ui/)
- [x] Validate custom hooks (5 hooks)
- [x] Validate Zustand stores (2 stores)
- [x] Validate Tailwind config theme

### Phase 3: Document Creation
- [x] Create comprehensive Project_Architecture_Document.md
- [x] Include Executive Summary
- [x] Include Architecture Overview with diagrams
- [x] Include Technology Stack (backend + frontend)
- [x] Include Repository Structure (detailed file tree)
- [x] Include Backend Architecture (models, controllers, resources)
- [x] Include Frontend Architecture (components, hooks, stores)
- [x] Include Database Schema with relationships
- [x] Include API Reference (all endpoints)
- [x] Include Design System tokens
- [x] Include State Management patterns
- [x] Include Development Workflow
- [x] Include Testing Strategy
- [x] Include Infrastructure & Deployment
- [x] Include Security Considerations
- [x] Include Common Pitfalls & Solutions
- [x] Include Phase Status & Roadmap
- [x] Include Quick Reference section

## Key Findings

### Discrepancies Resolved
1. **CLAUDE.md** stated "API Resources: ❌ MISSING" but they exist (14 resources found)
2. **CLAUDE.md** stated "Controllers: ⚠️ PARTIAL" but full 12 controllers exist
3. **AGENT.md** and **GEMINI.md** correctly reported backend as complete
4. Frontend hooks count: 5 (not 3 as stated in some docs)
5. Database tables: 26 migrations, 22 models

### Validated Ground Truth (Jan 9, 2026)
- Backend: **COMPLETE** (Models, Controllers, Resources, Routes)
- Frontend: **COMPLETE** (App Router, Components, Hooks, Stores)
- Database: **COMPLETE** (26 tables, all seeded)
- Design System: **COMPLETE** (Tailwind theme with custom tokens)
- Current Phase: 7 Complete → 7.1 (Product Detail Page)
