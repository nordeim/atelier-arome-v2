# Walkthrough: Documentation Updates

**Date:** January 9, 2026

---

## Summary

Updated two key documentation files to accurately reflect codebase state.

## Files Modified

### 1. [CLAUDE.md](file:///home/project/atelier-arome/CLAUDE.md)

- Added "Codebase Ground Truth" section (lines 88-124)
- Corrected database count: 24 → **26 tables**
- Documented model status: 16 implemented, 6 skeleton

### 2. [PHASE_2_BACKEND_CORE_PLAN.md](file:///home/project/atelier-arome/PHASE_2_BACKEND_CORE_PLAN.md)

**Key Corrections:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "9 of 22 models created" | "16 of 22 fully implemented, 6 skeleton" |
| "13 models missing" | "6 need completion" |
| "Create all 13 models" | "Complete 6 skeleton models" |

**Added:**
- "ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Verify Only)" section listing 7 completed models
- Validation note explaining previous inaccuracies
- Updated Phase 2.1 scope and checklists

## Validation Method

```bash
# Counted lines per model file
wc -l app/Models/*.php
# Skeleton: ~11 lines | Implemented: 40+ lines
```

## Impact

Phase 2.1 work reduced from "create 13 models" to "complete 6 skeleton models" — significant time savings.
