3. Technology stack validation for both backend and frontend
4. Complete Design System documentation
5. Frontend Component Architecture with atomic design pattern
6. Detailed Docker Infrastructure Deep Dive including:
   - PostgreSQL service configuration
   - Redis service configuration
   - Mailhog service configuration
   - Container status verification
   - Database configuration validation
   - Volume persistence details
   - Environment variables mapping
7. Backend implementation status with models, seeders, migrations
8. Security considerations
9. Performance optimizations
10. Next steps and recommendations
11. Project metrics and statistics
This provides a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase with rigorous attention to detail, including all the Docker infrastructure specifics the user provided.
Comprehensive deep understanding document saved to Deep_Project_Understanding_Document.md in project root. 
Document includes:
- Executive summary with status assessment (98% Foundation complete)
- Headless commerce architecture visualization
- Technology stack validation (Laravel 12 + Next.js 15)
- Illuminated Manuscript design system documentation
- Atomic component architecture (6 components validated)
- Docker Infrastructure Deep Dive:
  - PostgreSQL 16 Alpine service configuration
  - Redis 7.4 Alpine service configuration  
  - Mailhog email testing setup
  - Container status verification (3 containers healthy 22h)
  - Database schema verification (26 tables confirmed)
  - Volume persistence mapping
  - Environment variables correlation (.env ↔ docker-compose.yml)
- Backend implementation status (9/22 models, 6 seeders)
- Security & performance considerations
- Detailed next steps with prioritized action items
- Project metrics and timeline estimates
All docker infrastructure details from your configuration have been integrated and validated against actual running containers.
