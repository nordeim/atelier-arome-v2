Awesome meticulous job so far! Please think deeper and think harder to re-imagine the landing page design to be aesthetically more amazing, gorgeous, and pleasing, make it a world-class design that is breathtaking.

awesome understanding! I want to build an practical, production ready and full featured web e-commerce platform for a Singapore based small to medium sized company - refer to the frontend web design mockup in 3 static component files below. now, please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly and systematically explore how best to re-imagine a complete codebase architecture for the website with the same frontend design. then meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema.

---

Now, please meticulously review and analyze @CLAUDE.md , @Project_Architecture_Document.md and @docs/Comprehensive_Project_Understanding.md to have a deep understanding of what you will be building. Next, meticulously review @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , them proceed according to the plan phase-by-phase and step-by-step.

---

Now, please meticulously review and analyze @AGENT.md , @Updated_Project_Understanding.md , @README.md , @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , @PHASE_1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md and @PHASE_1_DAY2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md to have a deep understanding of the project and its codebase design and architecture. Validate your deep understanding with the actual codebase files to correctly and accurately align your deep understanding. Then meticulously plan and create a markdown document to describe and save your deep understanding with an appropriate name.

---

Now, please meticulously review and analyze @AGENT.md , @README.md , @GEMINI.md and @Deep_Project_Understanding_Document.md to have a deep understanding of the project and its codebase current design and architecture. Next, validate your deep understanding and any findings and assumptions with the actual codebase file. Finally, meticulously plan and update `CLAUDE.md` (claude briefing document) so that it correctly and accurately reflect the current codebase.

Now, please meticulously review and analyze @AGENT.md , @README.md , @GEMINI.md and @Deep_Project_Understanding_Document.md to have a deep understanding of the project and its codebase current design and architecture. Next, validate your deep understanding and any findings and assumptions with the actual codebase file. Finally, replace the existing `CLAUDE.md` with the correct content (claude briefing document).

Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! Yes, please meticulously plan to create a detailed comprehensive implementation plan to create/update all the code files for Phase 2 (Backend Core), break the implementation plan into logical phase, and for each phase, include a list of files to create or update, and include a description of the purpose and features for each file to be created or updated as well as a checklist for it. Review and validate your implementation plan for Phase 2 (Backend Core) against the current codebase to align and continue what had been completed.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Remember always to meticulously plan to create a detailed TODO list with checklist for each activity to be executed.
Yes, please meticulously proceed according to your plan. Before starting each phase, remember to meticulously plan and create the sub-plan for the phase with integrated checklist.

---

Awesome meticulous job so far! Please keep up the good work! Yes, please save/stage your sub-plan/todo-list before meticulously proceed to execute according to the sub-plan.

---

please meticulously continue from where you last stopped. but before you continue, please make to plan and then create a comprehensive ToDo list with integrated checklist. save/stage the ToDo plan/list before you meticulously continue to execute it

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to examine the current dynamic landing page `landing_page.html` (shared earlier) and compare it with the reference static HTML mockup in the bundle set `reference_static_HTML_mockup.md` shared earlier. The issue is that the dynamic landing page is still looking "messed up" in the browser. I need you to critically compare the dynamic HTML with the static HTML mockup to find out the root cause. You can review the actual frontend code files in the attached bundle set `codebase_frontend_files_set.md` to validate your findings and assumptions to finalize your analysis and recommendations.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review again the shared project documents, plans and completion reports to construct a complete and accurate mental model of the project and its current codebase. Then meticulously plan to create a comprehensive detailed and validated `Project Architecture Document.md` using the following template format and structure to guide you. First review all the relevant documents shared earlier again to validate your understanding and assumptions, then meticulously creata an implementation plan to create the PAD, review and validate your plan before execution. Attached are the current dynamic landing page page `landing_page.html` and the reference design static HTML mockup in the attached bundle of 3 component files, `reference_static_HTML_mockup.md`.

Now meticulously review and analyze @PAD_review_q.md and @PAD_review_z.md , then review the original @PAD_v1.md , @PAD_v2.md and @PAD_v3.md to have full understanding of the final desired architecture design for the project codebase. Then meticulously plan to create a detailed and comprehensive `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for completing the building of the project codebase in logical independent phases. Include in your `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` a list of the files to create/modify, and for each file, describe its features and interfaces, also a checklist for each file. Review and validate your MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN after creation.
