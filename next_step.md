✦ Executive Summary
  I have successfully reviewed and updated @GEMINI.md to accurately reflect the project's current status. The file now
  serves as a precise, up-to-date reference for the next session, confirming the completion of Phase 7.1 (Product Detail
  Page) and outlining the immediate next steps for Phase 8 (Cart System Integration).

  Detailed Plan & Rationale
   1. Analysis: I read the existing GEMINI.md and compared it against the tangible progress made in this session (backend
      verification, PDP implementation).
   2. Delta: The previous GEMINI.md was outdated, listing backend components as "partial" or "pending" and the frontend as
      "Phase 7 In Progress".
   3. Update Strategy:
       * Backend Status: Updated to "100% Core Complete" based on my earlier verification of all 22 models and 12
         controllers.
       * Frontend Status: Updated to "Phase 7.1 Complete", specifically detailing the new PDP components (VariantSelector,
         ImageGallery, etc.).
       * Next Steps: Shifted focus to Phase 8 @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, targeting the Cart Drawer and backend synchronization.

  Implementation
  I overwrote GEMINI.md with a structured, verified document that aligns with CLAUDE.md and
  Updated_Project_Understanding.md.

  Validation
   * Tech Stack: Correctly identifies Laravel 12 / Next.js 15.
   * Design System: Reaffirms the "Illuminated Manuscript" aesthetic and specific color tokens.
   * Operating Mode: Reinforces the "Meticulous" and "Construct and Conquer" methodologies.

  Next Steps
  The project is perfectly staged for Phase 8: Cart System Integration. The next session should focus on refining the
  vial-drawer.tsx and connecting it to the CartController.
