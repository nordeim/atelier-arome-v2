Thinking: Excellent! The user has successfully:
1. Cleared build cache and node_modules
2. Reinstalled dependencies
3. Successfully ran npm run build - build completed successfully
4. Started npm run dev - server is running on localhost:3000
The build output shows:
- ✓ Compiled successfully in 6.2s
- ✓ Linting and checking validity of types
- ✓ Collecting page data
- ✓ Generating static pages
- ✓ Collecting build traces
- Finalizing page optimization
And dev server is ready:
- ✓ Ready in 2.7s
- ✓ Compiled in 4.6s
- Server responding on http://localhost:3000
All the frontend build errors have been resolved! The user should now be able to:
1. Access the app at http://localhost:3000
2. Test the frontend
3. See the full build
This is a major milestone - the frontend is now building and running successfully after all the meticulous debugging and fixes.
I should acknowledge this success and summarize what was accomplished.
